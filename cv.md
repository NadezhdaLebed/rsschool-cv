3. **Summary:** Computer technology has always interested me. After graduation, I realized that I had chosen the wrong specialty, since at work I was more interested in working with a computer (website maintenance, writing reports, drawing up infographics and presentations). Recently, she began to learn HTML and CSS. At this stage, it is interesting to me and I am ready to learn further and apply all my strength and energy.

4. **Skills:** HTML, CSS.
